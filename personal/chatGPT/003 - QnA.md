# ListenAddr vs net.Listener?

ListenAddr and net.Listener serve different purposes in a TCP server implementation:

    ListenAddr is a configuration option that specifies the network address and port number that the server should listen on for incoming connections. It is usually set before the server starts running and does not change while the server is running.

    net.Listener is an interface provided by the Go standard library that allows a server to listen for incoming connections on a specific network address and port, and return a new net.Conn object for each connection. It is created by calling a function like net.Listen() or net.ListenTCP() and is used by the server to accept incoming connections and create new connections for each client.

In a typical TCP server implementation, ListenAddr is used to set up the server's initial configuration, while net.Listener is used to actually listen for and accept incoming connections. For example, the server might create a net.Listener object by calling net.ListenTCP() with the ListenAddr parameter, and then call the Accept() method on the listener to block and wait for incoming connections.

So, ListenAddr is a configuration option that specifies the server's initial address, while net.Listener is an interface that provides the functionality to actually listen for incoming connections on that address.

# OnPeer?
In a peer-to-peer network, it is important to maintain a list of peers that a node is connected to. This allows the node to communicate with other nodes and exchange information. The OnPeer callback function in the TCP transport implementation is used to notify the application layer when a new peer connection is established or when an existing peer connection is lost.

When a new peer connection is established, the OnPeer callback is called with a Peer object representing the new connection. The application layer can then use this object to send and receive messages to/from the peer. Similarly, when a peer connection is lost, the OnPeer callback is called with the Peer object representing the lost connection, and the application layer can take appropriate action (e.g., update its list of connected peers).

Overall, the OnPeer callback function is an important part of the TCP transport implementation as it allows the application layer to be notified of changes in the network topology and take appropriate actions.

# Difference between Accepting Connection and Handling Connection?
When a new connection request comes in, the operating system's network stack accepts the connection and returns a new net.Conn object representing the connection. Once a connection is accepted, it can then be handled by the application code.

Accepting a connection refers to the operating system's process of creating a new net.Conn object to represent a newly established network connection. This involves the operating system performing the necessary network stack operations to set up a new connection, such as establishing a TCP connection.

Handling a connection, on the other hand, refers to the application-level logic that processes data that is received over the connection. This can include things like parsing messages, performing protocol-specific actions, and responding to requests.

In the context of a server application, accepting connections typically happens in a loop, with the application accepting new connections as they arrive. Once a connection is accepted, it can then be handled by a separate goroutine or function in the application code.
